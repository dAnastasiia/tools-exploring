## Tools exploring

### pnpm

**pnpm** is a package manager for JavaScript projects, offering a unique approach to managing dependencies.  
_Unlike traditional package managers like npm or Yarn, PNPM stores each package version in a separate directory within the project, utilizing hard links and symlinks to reduce disk space usage and speed up installation times. This approach has several advantages, including faster installation speeds, reduced disk space usage, and improved caching mechanisms, making it an efficient choice for managing project dependencies._

### Vite

**Vite** is a build tool for web development, designed to optimize the developer experience and build performance.  
_By leveraging the esbuild bundler written in Go (multithreaded language compiled to machine code, unlike Webpack in classic CRA tool, written using JavaScript, which is interpreted and single-threaded, which in turn makes it slower), it significantly reduces build times and enhances the development experience with lightning-fast hot reloads. With its fast build times, instant hot module replacement, and support for various frameworks including React, Vue, SolidJS, Svelte, and Lit, Vite offers a streamlined workflow for creating high-performance web applications. Additionally, it provides built-in support for server-side rendering, further enhancing its appeal for building efficient and fast web projects._

### Refine

**Refine** is a React framework for web applications.  
_Refine can streamline the development process by offering industry-standard solutions._
